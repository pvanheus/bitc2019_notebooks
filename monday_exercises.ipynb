    "#### Finding prime numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer is prime if it is greater than 1 and only divisible by 1 and itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple test to see if a number is prime is to try and divide it by each number from 2 through to the largest integer which is less than or equal to the square root of the number. I.e. if you want to test 25, you could try and divide by 2, 3, 4 and 5 (and find out that 5 divides into 25 so the number is not prime).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is pseudocode for a testing whether a number is prime:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a positive integer greater than 2, let us call that numbers $X$\n",
    "2. Assume that $X$ is prime\n",
    "3. For each number (let us call it $Y$) from 2 through to square root of $X$\n",
    "    1. If $X$ is divisible by $Y$, it is not prime, and the loop can end\n",
    "4. If we get to the end of the loop without finding a number that divides evenly into $X$, the number is prime\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a square root of a number in Python using the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "root = math.sqrt(125)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `is_prime(number)`. This function should return `True` if the `number` is prime, otherwise it should return `False`."

    "#### Using your function\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `is_prime(number)` function created above, print all the prime numbers less than 100."

    "#### What is in the BUG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is some code that opens the `BUG1.tsv` file and prints out some of the fields in the file, specifically, the protein name, NCBI accession of the best matching protein, the kingdom of that match and the class of that match.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adapt the code to count how many alpha, beta, gamma and deltaproteobacteria matches there are.\n",
    "2. Besides these classes, what other bacterial classes are found in these matches? Write code to answer this question, returning the list of \"other classes\" as a list.\n",
    "3. Make a bar graph of how many alpha, beta, gamma and deltaproteobacteria matches there are.\n",
    "4. Example what line 5 of the code does."
